# μo_C SE

## 8HP Eurorack module | Polymorphic CV generator

[μo_C SE](http://uoc-se.com) is a multi-purpose module in which a generic set of inputs and outputs are remapped on-the-fly through the use of a number of different built-in apps.

This re-engineered Eurorack module updates and simplifies the classic [Ornament & Crime](http://ornament-and-cri.me/) (aka o_C) design by miniaturizing the module from 14HP to 8HP and redesigning the front panel layout without eliminating any functionality.

Fully compatible with upstream o_C firmware. Includes power cable, mounting hardware, and a one-year warranty. Designed and built with care by [Tall Dog Electronics](http://tall-dog.com) in Western Massachusetts.
